- Search for *ranger desktop entry*: `ranger.desktop`
it should be somewhere in:

```bash
~/usr/share/applications/  
# or
~/.local/share/applications
```

You can use these commands to find it:
```bash
ls ~/usr/share/applications/ | grep ranger.desktop
```
```bash
ls ~/.local/share/applications | grep ranger.desktop
```

- Edit the `ranger.desktop` file (you'll need sudo permissions)
```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=ranger
Comment=Launches the ranger file manager
Icon=utilities-terminal

# Set this to false:
Terminal=false

# Place your terminal emulator here to execute ranger like this:
Exec=alacritty -e ranger

Categories=ConsoleOnly;System;FileTools;FileManager
MimeType=inode/directory;
Keywords=File;Manager;Browser;Explorer;Launcher;Vi;Vim;Python
```
